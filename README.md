# Partitioning-the-Sample-Space-for-a-More-Precise-Shannon-Entropy-Estimation
ulia implementation of the algorithms from the paper "Partitioning the Sample Space for a More Precise Shannon Entropy Estimation"."
In addition to the code provided, this repository includes results from additional experiments not reported in the manuscript. These experiments cover three extra distributions following Zipf decaying laws and two additional support sizes (500 and 1000). For comparison, we also added the same set of results for the Chao-Shen estimator.
